# llm-finetuning
## Enabling Quality Embedding and Text Generation for Amharic Language

## Business Need

This project aims to fine-tune an llm so that it can understand the Amharic language to improve customer support for AfreTech Solutions. 

## Project Overview

The project is organized into several tasks to achieve the business goals:

1. **Literature Review & Huggingface Ecosystem (Task 1):**
   - Understand key concepts and methods related to LLMs.
   - Explore the Huggingface ecosystem for inference and fine-tuning.
   - Review relevant literature and resources.

2. **Load an LLM and Use It for Inference (Task 2):**
   - Set up the work environment.
   - Choose an open-source LLM and load it.
   - Test the model's inference capabilities for various scenarios.

3. **Data Preprocessing and Preparation (Task 3):**
   - Parse and clean raw Telegram message data.
   - Extract and remove unnecessary features.
   - Prepare the data for fine-tuning.

4. **Fine-Tuning the LLM (Task 4):**
   - Understand the key components of LLM training and fine-tuning.
   - Choose a base model and fine-tune it for Amharic text.
   - Explore Huggingface documentation for inference and fine-tuning.
